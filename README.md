# Numerical Polynomial Solver (Romberg Integration & Richardson Differentiation)

## Overview
Numerical Polynomial Solver is a **Java-based numerical computation tool** that computes the **derivative** and **integral** of a polynomial function using:
- **Romberg's Integration** for numerical integration
- **Richardson's Extrapolation** for numerical differentiation

This project demonstrates advanced numerical methods and file handling in Java.

## Features
✅ Computes **derivatives** using Richardson’s Extrapolation  
✅ Computes **definite integrals** using Romberg’s Integration  
✅ Reads polynomial coefficients from an input file  
✅ Interactive **CLI-based user input**  

## File Format (Input)
The input file should contain the highest power of the polynomial on the first line and the polynomial coefficients in **descending order** of powers on the second line.  
**Example (`poly1.pol`):**
